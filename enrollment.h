/*
A class called Enrollment that represents an individual employee's enrollment in a course. The class
should have a constructor that initializes the enrollment with a reference to the employee and a
reference to the course. The class should also have a destructor that deallocates any memory used by
the object.

â€¢ A class called Enrollment Manager that manages employee enrollments. The class should be
implemented as a std::map container that stores objects of type Enrollment.
